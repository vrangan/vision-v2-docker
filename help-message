This is the docker container to build the vision-v2 repos.
The container is created with the needed modules to build with quick build
using the top level Makefile (which downloads the appropriate cross compilation
tools and does all the work) or step by step using the steps as defined in the Software Technical Reference manual (which requires the riscv cross compiler
to be installed)

The command line give below is  how to run the docker container
